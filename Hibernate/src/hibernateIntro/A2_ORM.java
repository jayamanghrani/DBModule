// ORM Introduction

/*ORM is a software tool that provides a simple API for storing and retrieving Java objects directly from database.

*ORM maintains  a connection between an object and relational database.

*
*/
/*
 * In simple words it is the process of mapping tables to class objects, so that
 * data transactions could be easier.
 */

/*
 * Apart from mapping , an ORM can also help a programmer maintain associations
 * between 2 objects and reflect them as relationships in 2 tables
